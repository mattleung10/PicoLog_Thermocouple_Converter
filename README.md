# PicoLog_Thermocouple_Converter
This program is used to obtain thermocouple temperature readings (Type T), based on voltage readings, and a reference thermocouple junction temperature measured by a RTD. This program was created when I was working as a research assistant at the National University of Singapore Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## Overview

For use with Pico Technology [PicoLog ADC-20/ADC-24 Data Loggers](https://www.picotech.com/data-logger/adc-20-adc-24/precision-data-acquisition). The RTD is put in a voltage divider circuit (input voltage +2.5V), in series with a resistor, and the voltage across the RTD is measured. Based on these parameters, the program calculates a temperature reading, which is the reference thermocouple junction temperature. The program then takes voltage values (mV) from the CSV output files of the PicoLog, and converts them into temperature values (째C) based on the junction reference temperature, using polynomial approximation formulas from [NIST and ITS-90](https://srdata.nist.gov/its90/download/type_t.tab).


There are options to do a direct conversion (mV to 째C, or 째C to mV) or to convert all values inside a CSV file.

## Usage

Simply run the ```Picolog_Conversion.py``` file; Or download the ```Picolog_Conversion``` folder and run the ```Picolog_Conversion.exe``` standalone executable. The main menu of the program is showed below.

After the conversion, the program creates a new CSV file with the converted temperature values, called ```<filename>_converted.csv```. See the example CSV files in the [sample](https://github.com/mattleung10/PicoLog_Thermocouple_Converter/tree/master/sample) folder.
